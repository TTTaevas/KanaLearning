# KanaLearning

KanaLearning is a webpage created to help people learn [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) and [Katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) through repeated failure, aka brute-forcing.

It may also be used to test out your way to [type in Japanese](https://www.coscom.co.jp/learnjapanese801/msime_win10_en1.html), by constantly switching through three different alphabets; Hiragana, Katakana & Romaji.

KanaLearning is currently available on [GitHub Pages](https://tttaevas.github.io/KanaLearning/).
